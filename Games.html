							<div class="innerL" id="lwhDiv" title="Long way home">
							
							<img src="">
							<p>This is a game where all the players take the role of ideas in the head of a very drunk

man trying to return home after a long night of drinking. Each player plans out a single action and then

each action is played out in turn order. The player try to work with each other to accomplish various

goals and tasks, while also trying to keep the other player from fulfilling their own ideas. The winner is

the player with the greatest total of points at the end of the game, which can happen in a number of

different ways: if he sobers up, if he falls unconscious, if he manages to get home or if too much time

passes and his wife finds him out in the street.</p>

							<img src="">
							<p>The City of Hexopoly is the next big industrial and trading center. At least that is what speculated in the market. After checking with a few of your sources, it might be true! You, as big entrepreneur, have decided to invest in land and housing in Hexopoly while it's still cheap. Unfortunately, you are not the only one! A few of your rivals have heard that the city of Hexopoly is a splendid opportunity to make a lot of money! It is time for you to prove to them who is the best in the business! Until Hexopoly is fully built you have to acquire land, build and sell houses and build other buildings that will make Hexopoly a great city and, of course, make you the most wealth.</p>

							</div>
							<div style="margin-left:20px;"><p>The ruins of the ancient kingdom called Levarie hide many treasures – and that is exactly what many heroes and adventures, both brave and crazy, are looking for...</p>
							<p>The stories about the hidden treasure have attracted many, but the travelers and wise men whisper about terrible creatures that lurk in the shadows and prey upon those who come near these ancient buildings. But this does not stop many adventurers to still look for the treasure, hoping that their skills and wit will be enough to defeat any monster.</p>
							<p>This is a game for 2 to 4 players, based on the popular game „Sorry“. Instead on nameless markers, players are controlling some of the many available characters with special powers and battling against one of the six different monsters.</p>
							<p>The player who manages to defeat the monster first is the winner. At the start of the game, players choose one of the six unique monsters to be their final enemy – but this also slightly changes the way the game is played, making every game play a different experience. Every player starts the game with three different characters, but during the course of the game they will increase their powers, or swapped for a different character.</p></div>

							<p>the player take the rolls of hackers running through codes of data trying to collect what they

need while preventing the other players from reaching their goal before they do. The board is set out by

tiles with different code element presented on them, and ass the players move their pieces from one

space to the other, they perform the various actions on the spaces, reprogramming potentially harmful

effects or sending them to effect other players instead. Some spaces grant victory points in the form of

data, while running through the complete code grands data based on the number of tiles completed.

The first player to reach 10 points of data collected wins.</p>

							<p>This is a game about survival on a desserted two dimensional island. Players are stickman who try to survive hazards of the island - the vulcano and monster that lives in it and to build a raft and escape together. The game board consists of two boards, between which the game shifts, and that change perspective on items, board and the way of thinking.</p>

							<img src="">
							<p>- is an abstract game of rugby for 2 players. Each player controls a team of 5 pieces, with the

goal of gaining control of the ball and moving it over the opponent’s end zone. Similar to games like

Chess and Go, players take turns moving one piece at a time as they try to outsmart and outmaneuver

the other player to get the best possible position to win. The winner is the first player to pass the

opponents end-line with a piece carrying the ball.</p>
